<<< Getting setup : Installing Python 2.7 >>>

1.
Go to https://www.python.org/ and download Python 2.7.x (for Windows)

2.
Run python-2.7.x.amd64.msi and install it. Make sure it is for 64bit.
(Tested working in C:\Python27\)


3.
Set enviroment variable PATH.
Here, it is C:\Python27\ for python, and C:\Python27\Scripts for pip.

Make sure that you can use "python" and "pip" command on Command Prompt.

> where python
C:\Python27\python.exe

Go to https://git-for-windows.github.io/ and download it.

2.
Run the installer and install git.
Make sure you use Git from the Windows Command Prompt.
(Tested working in C:\Program Files\Git)

3.
After installing, make sure you can use "git" command.

> where git
C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe




<<< Installing Visual Studio >>>

For installing Twisted for python and for compiling for leveldb,
You need to install Visual Studio.

If you've already installed it, you can skip follow steps.

1.
Go to https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/ and download 
Visual Studio 2017 Community and run it.




<<< Downloading the necessary dependencies >>>

Open Command Prompt and type the following commands:

1. 
pip install jsonpickle

2.
Go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266
and install Visual C++ Compiler for Python27.
(This is necessary to install Twisted as follow)

3. 
pip install Twisted




<<< Compiling leveldb for Windows >>>

"pip install leveldb" doesn't work because it's not officially supported on Windows.
So you need to compile it with Visual Studio 2013 tool set as following repository.

1.
Go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48129
Download wdexpress_full.exe and install.
(You can skip this step if you've already installed Visual Studio 2013 tool set)

2.
Compile leveldb with following repository on Visual Studio.
https://github.com/happynear/py-leveldb-windows




<<< Cloning the Quantum Resistant Ledger source code from github >>>


In the Command Prompt, type the following command:

git clone https://github.com/surg0r/QRL 
(this will download the source code to C:\Users\yourname\QRL)




<<< Running the node >>>


In the Command Prompt, type the following commands:

1.
cd QRL (Open the QRL folder)


2. 
sudo python node.py (Run the node.py script)


If you've set it up correctly, it should start to output the following:

loading db
loading wallet
Creating new wallet file..this could take up to a minute


After the wallet is created it will start syncronizing the chain.
This might take a while, leave it running untill the chain is sync




<<< Accessing the wallet >>>


Download and Install PuTTY:
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

1. Run node.py 

2. Once it starts the synchronisation process, you can telnet into the node.
  
   Run PuTTY and Specify the destination as follows.

   Host Name : localhost
   Port : 2000
   Connection type : Telnet   

3. type help for the cmd list
